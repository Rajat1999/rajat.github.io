                                We are a organization which is working on this huge problem of parking facilities in metro cities like Delhi.<br>
                                Delhi is considered the worst city in the world in terms of the availability and quality of parking space. 
                                While efforts by successive governments have failed to address the problem.
                                Its plan of action is very much in line with what transportation experts have been demanding for many years—higher parking rates, limited parking space and improvement in the public transport system.
                                At Delhi’s traffic and congestion problem, the government was not in favour of constructing more parking lots. 
                                People buy a car for Rs 2 lakhs and expect the government to construct parking for it for Rs 10 lakh. 
                                Why should the government do that? The government is not responsible for creating more parking for people. 
                                Parking is the responsibility of the person who has bought the car.
                                While the government is firm on changing the parking policy, officials say it will take time to implement it. 
                                “The government will have to strengthen the public transport system before increasing parking rates. It is a long-term plan. 
                                We can’t inconvenience people by increasing the parking rates without providing adequate public transport,” said a source in the government.

                            Through this website we register your land for parking lot or parking areas.
                            From here you can register your land.
                            We feels that the authorities who plan the Indian cities should really look into the situation. 
                            The public policy needs to be structured in such a way that the issue can be tackled effectively.
                            One way to handle this is to take away the subsidy provided for parking. 
                            So the charges for parking should be determined as per the land value of the particular area or the rent that is being charged for the same. 
                            It is also important that major sites of tourist interest, the heritage zones and shopping areas are made strictly off limit for cars.
                            And therefore we have built a system through which people can have benefits.
                            This system covers two type of peoples, first one are those who need to have info about nearby parking structures or availability of parking lots in the place they are going.
                            Second kind of person are those who have extra piece of land which is of no use and they want to make money from this land, and hence they can put it for parking purpose.
                            For both of these kind we have different interface.
                            So registration can be done form this site only, and from our app user can get the full info about parking lots let it be a free one or a paid one.
                            Also he can book it in advance for parking.
